The idea is simple: weâ€™ll learn Unity3D by making this little ship move in XR.  

The goal is to create a short lesson of less than five minutes that you can follow at home.  
There are additional packages for time management, music, and subtitles available in the Git repository.  

For fun, create a **fan art** of *Outer Wilds*! ðŸš€âœ¨
